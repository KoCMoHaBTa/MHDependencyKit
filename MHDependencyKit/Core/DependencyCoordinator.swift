/**
 DependencyCoordinator is used to register depndency resolving handlers and resolve dependencies between 2 objects.
 There are various UIKit resolvers, used to resolve dependencies between 2 view controllers and segues.
 
 It solves the problem of the dependecy hell management between view controllers in any app.
 
 - note: The automatic dependecy segue resolver works by swizzling the `prepareForSegue:sender:` method
 - note: In order for automatic dependecy segue resolver to work - you must use segues and you must call super if you override `prepareForSegue:sender:` method
 
 How to use:
 - register your resolvers that resolve your dependencies between 2 view controllers
 - automatic - when any segue is triggered - all handlers that are applying to the source and destination will be called
 - manual - by calling any of the provided `resolveDependencies` methods on the receiver
