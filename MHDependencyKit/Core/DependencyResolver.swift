/**
 A type that resolvers dependencies from a provider to a consumer.
 
 The concept of this type is to define the resolution of dependencies in a direct way between a dependcy provider and dependency consumer.
 The `consumer` is the type that requires some dependencies to be resolved (provided).
 The `provider` is the type that provides the dependencies to the consumer.
 The provider and the consumer are not tied to any specific type, so its up to the implementation to decide how to deal with them.
