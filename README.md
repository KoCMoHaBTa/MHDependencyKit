[![Build Status](https://app.bitrise.io/app/960ddc82f9c41a2d/status.svg?token=b-p9ilqSddTTaN13e4YYOw&branch=master)](https://app.bitrise.io/app/960ddc82f9c41a2d)

**MHDependencyKit** is lightweight library that helps resolves dependencies between objects in a workflow manner. 

Its goal is to solve the complexity of resolving dependencies and data transfer between UIViewController transitions.
In its core, the abstraction is not limited to UIKit, so its possible to define your own implementation of how to resolve dependenies by just implementing the `DependencyResolver` protocol.
